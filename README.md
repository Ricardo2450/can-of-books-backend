# Can of books app

**Author**: Ricardo Soto-Fabela, Gordon Reilley
**Version**: 1.0

## Overview

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. We are building an app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

1. Connect your front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Your Express server will connect to a MongoDB database. 

2. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look. 

3. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
